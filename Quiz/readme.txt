Login & data entry, I didn't have enough time implement it, if I had 3 more days I could maybe, attempted it.

Apache & MSQL server is needed xampp is included. 

Their is no password & their, only 1 quiz.
15 questions 4 answers each.
Final output could been any questions and answers but I settled for topping sauce. 
It asks you 4 questions and each one is specific type of answer relating to 4 toppings. 

Decision was made so that it only handle one category per answer & 
all categories need be present for each question.
This was just quiz design choice.

This quiz will only work when have 1 category per answer. Meaning if you want 5 category Quiz you need 
5 Answers for each question.

I wanted introduce multi category however my listing using % wouldn't represent the quiz correctly
